                    To further help our project have maximum impact during the first tournament, we will have an NFT sale. These NFTs are generated by an established artist in the NFT (both Ethereum and Cardano) space. His pieces are derived from training AI over countless hours, indexing myriad of chess pieces, connecting multiple neural networks, and painstakingly rendering new art from the mind of a computer. How fantastic is that?

                    This platform is about making a positive impact, by helping students who are interested in pursuing a higher education, a fair chance at winning a scholarship. We advise those interested in contributing to our cause, to donate, and receive these NFTs purely as a badge of honor within the crypto community.</p>

                        If you or your organization donate $10,000+  crypto to this initiative, our artist will generate a custom AI rendering NFT of whatever you choose. Should you choose to, provide us with a couple pictures of yourself, our AI artist will generate an NFT avatar that is unique to each of our contributors. Using the theme of your choice, we will generate as an NFT that is 1 of 1. Each AI generated piece can never be replicated, you’ll be the only owner ever who has that specific NFT. We encourage any individuals or entities who are interested in becoming a large donor to reach out.

                                The chess game will have preliminary rounds to determine ranks. This will be the calibration phase to make sure each player is in the correct tier. Once a player is ranked based on win / loss ratios, they’ll enter into brackets. Brackets will be based on ranks. Eventually going down to a final game between two opponents, and the winner being awarded a yet to be determined amount towards college tuition.

Details are being withheld about the exact measures to prevent creative circumventions to anti-cheating measure.

                            After the first high school only tournament, we will open a second chess tournament to the general public. This is how we will ensure the prize account for the students will always have funds. A percentage from the entry fees of the general public competition, will go towards the scholarship fund. An overly simplistic example would be the following. General public competition #1 entry fee is 10 ADA. 1 Ada will be diverted to scholarship fund, 9 ADA will go into general competition fund.

                                competitors will pay a very small entry fee (roughly $20 in crypto) for a chance at the grand prize.The prize fund, and entry fee portions that will contribute to the grand prize will automatically go into a smart contract, programmed to pay to the winning student’s university of choice.

                                The amount of funds from the entry fees contributing to the final prize will vary based on amount of competitors enrolled. We want the prize pool to make a substantial difference in terms of tuition, not just a portion of it. And not only for the first year of the competition but every year thereafter. Thus, we must calculate how much will go towards this year, vs next year’s competition.
