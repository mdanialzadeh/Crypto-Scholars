                    To further help our project have maximum impact during the first tournament, we will have an NFT sale. These NFTs are generated by an established artist in the NFT (both Ethereum and Cardano) space. His pieces are derived from training AI over countless hours, indexing myriad of chess pieces, connecting multiple neural networks, and painstakingly rendering new art from the mind of a computer. How fantastic is that?    
                </h3>
                <h3 class="nft_about2">
                    This platform is about making a positive impact, by helping students who are interested in pursuing a higher education, a fair chance at winning a scholarship. We advise those interested in contributing to our cause, to donate, and receive these NFTs purely as a badge of honor within the crypto community.</h3>

                    <p>
                        If you or your organization donate $10,000+ of crypto to this initiative, our artist will generate a custom AI rendering NFT of whatever you choose. Should you choose to, provide us with a couple pictures of yourself, we can have our AI artist generate an NFT avatar that is fully and uniquely yours. Using the theme of your choice, we will generate as an NFT that is 1 of 1. Each AI generated piece can never be replicated, youâ€™ll be the only owner ever who has that specific NFT. We encourage any individuals or entities who are interested in becoming a large donor to reach out.
